                <p><strong>Requires Attunement:</strong> Cleric or Warlock</p>
                <p>This ancient tome, bound in dark leather and inscribed with faintly glowing runes, serves as both a conduit to the dead and a protector of the living. Its yellowed pages seem endless, filling with names as the wielder's connection to life and death deepens.</p>

                    <div class="ability-title">Communion with the Departed</div>
                    <p>You always have the spell <strong>Speak with Dead</strong> prepared, and it does not count against the spells you know.</p>
                    <p>You can cast <strong>Speak with Dead</strong> once per long rest without expending a spell slot or requiring material components by writing the name of the deceased into the book.</p>

                <div class="ability">
                    <div class="ability-title">Names of the Bound</div>
                    <p>The book can hold a number of names equal to your <strong>proficiency bonus</strong>. With your permission, a creature can use its action to inscribe its name into the book.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="ability">
                    <div class="ability-title">Twilight Ward</div>
                    <p>When a creature whose name is in the book would be reduced to 0 hit points (but not killed outright), you can use your <strong>reaction</strong> to summon a ward that absorbs the damage.</p>
                    <p>The damage is reflected back to the attacker, who must make a <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong> against your <strong>spell save DC</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Failure:</strong> The attacker takes half the damage inflicted on the target.</li>
                        <li><strong>Success:</strong> The attacker takes no damage, and the ward dissipates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once triggered, no creature can benefit from this ability until you finish a long rest.</p>

                <div class="ability">
                    <div class="ability-title">Sending Across the Veil</div>
                    <p>You can cast <strong>Sending</strong> targeting a creature whose name is in the book without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. To do so, write your message in the book.</p>
                    <p>The target hears the message in their mind. If they reply, their message appears on the page instead of in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="ability">
                    <div class="ability-title">Erasure</div>
                    <p>As an action, you can magically erase any name from the book by touching it.</p>
